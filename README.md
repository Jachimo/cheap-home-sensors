## TempSensor (ESP8266 + BME280)

A wireless indoor air sensor, written using MicroPython for the ESP8266 and the
Bosch BME280 I2C temp/humid sensor.

  the `umqttsimple` library.  I can verify that this code does work, but it has
  inlined WiFi credentials and is probably best used as a starting point.

  MicroPython but uses the modern BME280 sensor.

  my goal of a very inexpensive temperature sensor with the 8266!

  client operation; avoids some failure modes of the official uP library.

### Environment Setup

1. Install Thonny: `pip3 install thonny` *should* work, or alternately they have
   a one-line installer for most Linux platforms:  
   `bash <(wget -O - https://thonny.org/installer-for-linux)`  
   On MacOS, the .pkg installer seems to be more reliable, and brings its own
   Python 3.10 instance with it.
2. If needed, install the appropriate USB/Serial adapter chip drivers.


### Hardware Setup

* The code assumes that the BME sensor is connected via I2C to pins 4 and 5.
  Specifically: `sda=machine.Pin(4), scl=machine.Pin(5)`
