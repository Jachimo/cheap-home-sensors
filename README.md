## TempSensor (ESP8266 + BME280)

A wireless indoor air sensor, written using MicroPython for the ESP8266 and the
Bosch BME280 I2C temp/humid sensor.

  with MicroPython support
* [Getting Started with MQTT on ESP32/ESP8266][rnt] - Uses the uPyCraft IDE and
  the `umqttsimple` library.  I can verify that this code does work, but it has
  inlined WiFi credentials and is probably best used as a starting point.
* [ESP8266 with BME280 using Arduino IDE][rnt2] - Uses Arduino instead of
  MicroPython but uses the modern BME280 sensor.
* [MicroPython: MQTT â€“ Publish BME280 Sensor Readings][rnt3] - Very close to
  my goal of a very inexpensive temperature sensor with the 8266!

### Environment Setup

1. Install Thonny: `pip3 install thonny` *should* work, or alternately they have
   a one-line installer for most Linux platforms:  
   `bash <(wget -O - https://thonny.org/installer-for-linux)`  
   On MacOS, the .pkg installer seems to be more reliable, and brings its own
   Python 3.10 instance with it.
2. If needed, install the appropriate USB/Serial adapter chip drivers.
